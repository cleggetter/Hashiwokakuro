Hashiwokakuro (count your bridges)

This is a logic puzzle, based on islands and bridges.

The only land humanity has left is a bunch of circular 
islands where each continent used to be. Fortunately, we have some good engineers. We are 
planning to connect the islands to each other through a network of straight-line bridges. 
But, of course, there are rules:

   1. The bridges cannot cross each other or pass over islands, and can only be placed 
      horizontally (east-west) or vertically (north-south). (Diagonal bridges are too 
      difficult for your engineers to build.)
   2. A pair of islands can’t be connected by more than two bridges.
   3. All the islands must be connected together in a single, contiguous group. In other 
      words, the people on any given island need to be able to reach every other island, 
      even if they have to take a circuitous route.
   4. Each island (represented by a circle on the diagrams below) has a value equal to the 
      total number of bridges that connect it to its neighbors.
   5. To connect the islands appropriately, you’ll need to follow the diamond-shaped signs 
      sprinkled throughout this dystopia. Each corner of the sign corresponds to one of the 
      four directions (north, south, east, west), and the numbers in those corners show the 
      sum of the values of the islands that lie on a straight line extending in that 
      direction. No value can be repeated within a single sum — for example, if the sum 
      is 10, the values that make it up cannot be 5 and 5.
   6. The bridges cannot pass through the signs.
